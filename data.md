# Data

The bulk of our data comes from [the GDELT Project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/), a database which accumulates and analyzes news and media from around the world in a variety of ways. We filtered it using Google BigQuery's SQL-like syntax (see [this page](https://www.gdeltproject.org/data.html#googlebigquery) for info on GDELT's Google BigQuery hosting and [this page](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2014/05/worlds-largest-event-dataset-now-publicly-available-in-google-bigquery.html) to access the BigQuery tables), bash scripts, and python scripts with a few extra libraries. 

For a few more details see the [Data section of our Processbook](processbook.md#data) and for all of the rest checkout our [Github repo](https://github.com/mbovel/dataviz-project).
