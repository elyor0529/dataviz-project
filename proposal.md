# Proposal

## Project name
A network of news sites

## Objective (min 300 words)
The Gdelt project (see links below) provide several datasets related to the news and the news coverage. One of
them relates news events to a unique ID and report any publication about this event in the online news. A
network of news sites can be made to get a better picture of how much they share the same information. News
that report the same events would be linked in the network. The connection weights would increase as the
number of shared news increases. Can we make some interesting and clean visualizations of the news sites
landscape? Can we categorize them? Are there news sites that are more central? Do we get different networks if
we take into account news related to particular topics? Can we combine additional info present in the data with
the graph to get additional insights?
